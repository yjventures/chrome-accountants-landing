## Content to Handle With Care
- Legacy short paths (e.g. `/bas-and-ias-lodgement`, `/payroll-superannuation-mgmt`) → prefer canonical `/pages/services/...` routes.
- Exclude `/404`, `/thank-you`, preview or campaign pages.

## Additional Context
- **Trust metrics**: 400+ clients, $2.5M+ tax savings, 95% retention, 4.9-star Google rating.
- **Audience**: Individuals and SMEs in Sydney/NSW seeking compliance + advisory.
- **Canonical**: Always use `https://www.chromeaccountants.com.au/` with `www`.
